To complete your request, I'll break down the process of installing Kali Linux, setting up DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application), testing vulnerabilities, capturing screenshots with date/time, and compiling everything into a Google Doc. Since I cannot physically execute these tasks for you, I’ll guide you step by step on how you can do this yourself.

---

### **1. Install Kali Linux**

You can install Kali Linux either on a **Virtual Machine (VM)** or a **physical machine**. Below, I'll guide you through the **VM installation process** using **VirtualBox**, as this is a common setup for ethical hacking environments.

#### **Step 1: Download Kali Linux ISO**
1. Visit the [official Kali Linux website](https://www.kali.org/downloads/) and download the **Kali Linux ISO** that corresponds to your system (64-bit or 32-bit).

#### **Step 2: Install VirtualBox**
1. Download and install [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2. After installation, open VirtualBox and create a new VM:
   - Click on **New**.
   - Set the **Name** to Kali Linux, choose **Linux** as the type, and select **Debian (64-bit)** for the version.
   - Assign at least **2GB of RAM**.
   - Create a **new virtual hard disk** (VDI) with at least **20GB of space**.

#### **Step 3: Install Kali Linux on VirtualBox**
1. Start the new VM and select the downloaded Kali Linux ISO as the bootable disk.
2. Follow the Kali Linux installation prompts:
   - **Language**, **Location**, and **Keyboard** settings.
   - Set up **network** preferences and **user** credentials.
   - Complete the installation and reboot the system.

#### **Step 4: Log into Kali Linux**
Once installed, log into your Kali Linux system.

### **2. Set Up DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**

DVWA is a web application designed for testing and learning web application security vulnerabilities.

#### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
Open the terminal and install the necessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 mysql-server php php-mysqli libapache2-mod-php
```

#### **Step 2: Download DVWA**
Navigate to the Apache web directory and download DVWA from GitHub:

```bash
cd /var/www/html/
sudo git clone https://github.com/digininja/DVWA.git
```

#### **Step 3: Set Permissions**
Set the correct permissions for the DVWA directory:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/DVWA
```

#### **Step 4: Configure DVWA**
1. Go to the DVWA config file and edit the database credentials:

```bash
sudo nano /var/www/html/DVWA/config/config.inc.php
```

2. Find the following lines and make sure they are set as follows:

```php
$_DVWA['db_user'] = 'root';
$_DVWA['db_password'] = '';
```

#### **Step 5: Create the DVWA Database**
1. Start MySQL:

```bash
sudo service mysql start
```

2. Log in to MySQL:

```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

3. Create the database for DVWA:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE dvwa;
exit;
```

#### **Step 6: Start Apache and MySQL**
Make sure Apache and MySQL are running:

```bash
sudo service apache2 start
sudo service mysql start
```

#### **Step 7: Complete the Setup**
Open a browser and visit `http://localhost/DVWA/setup.php`. Click the "Create / Reset Database" button to set up the DVWA database.

### **3. Test 5 Vulnerabilities on DVWA**

Once DVWA is set up, you can test various vulnerabilities. I'll list **five common vulnerabilities** for you to test:

#### **1. SQL Injection (Low-Level)**
- Navigate to **DVWA -> SQL Injection (Low)**.
- In the input field, test the following payload:
  ```sql
  ' OR 1=1 --
  ```

This will check if the application is vulnerable to SQL injection by bypassing authentication.

#### **2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- Go to **DVWA -> XSS (Reflected)**.
- Inject the following payload:
  ```html
  <script>alert('XSS')</script>
  ```

Check if the alert pops up in the browser.

#### **3. File Upload Vulnerability**
- Go to **DVWA -> File Upload**.
- Try uploading a PHP file with malicious code. For example, create a PHP shell with this content:
  ```php
  <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
  ```
- Verify if the file is uploaded and accessible.

#### **4. Command Injection**
- Visit **DVWA -> Command Injection**.
- Try entering a command like:
  ```bash
  ; ls
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  ; whoami
  ```

Check if the command is executed on the server.

#### **5. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**
- Visit **DVWA -> CSRF**.
- Use a proxy tool like **Burp Suite** or a custom HTML form to craft a request and test for CSRF vulnerabilities by submitting forms without authorization.

---

### **4. Capture Screenshots with Date/Time**

To capture screenshots with date/time, you can use the `gnome-screenshot` tool or `scrot` (a command-line tool).

#### **Using GNOME Screenshot:**
1. Press `PrtSc` or run `gnome-screenshot` from the terminal.
2. Enable the option **"Include the pointer"** or **"Add timestamp"** to show the date and time on your screenshots.

#### **Using Scrot (Terminal Screenshot Tool):**
```bash
scrot '%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S.png' -e 'mv $f ~/Pictures/'
```
This will save the screenshot with the current date and time in the filename.

### **5. Compile Everything into a Google Doc**

1. **Create a Google Doc:**
   - Open [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com) and create a new document.

2. **Insert Installation Steps:**
   - Copy the instructions and paste them into the Google Doc, including the steps to install Kali Linux, set up DVWA, and test the vulnerabilities.

3. **Insert Screenshots:**
   - Insert the screenshots you took for each vulnerability test:
     - Click **Insert** → **Image** → **Upload from computer**.
     - Upload the screenshots and place them next to the corresponding instructions.

4. **Share the Google Doc:**
   - After finishing the document, click on the **Share** button at the top-right.
   - Set the sharing option to **Anyone with the link** and **Viewer** permission.
   - Copy the sharing link.

### **Conclusion**

By following these steps, you will:

- **Install Kali Linux** on your machine or VM.
- **Set up DVWA** to simulate web application vulnerabilities.
- **Test 5 vulnerabilities** (SQL Injection, XSS, File Upload, Command Injection, and CSRF).
- **Capture screenshots** with date/time.
- **Compile everything in a Google Doc** with instructions, vulnerabilities tested, and screenshots.

Once the Google Doc is ready, you'll be able to share the link with others for review.
